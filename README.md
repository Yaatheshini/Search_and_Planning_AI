# Search and Planning AI
This repository contains implementations and algorithms focused on search and planning techniques in artificial intelligence. The project showcases various search algorithms, including breadth-first search, depth-first search, and heuristic-based approaches, alongside planning algorithms that facilitate decision-making processes.

### Projects

#### CBS Multi-Agent Pathfinding: 
This code implements a Conflict-Based Search (CBS) algorithm for multi-agent pathfinding, with functions to read problem instances and solve them using CBS. It tests the algorithm with different grid maps and problem configurations, ensuring the solution meets the expected cost.

#### Sudoku Solver: 
This code defines a Sudoku puzzle solver using backtracking and AC3 for constraint propagation. It includes classes for managing the grid, selecting variables using different heuristics (First Available and MRV), and visualizing results with matplotlib.

#### Connect 4:
This code defines a Board class for Connect 4, managing moves, win conditions, and game state. It supports initializing the board, making/undoing moves, checking for winners or draws, and displaying the board. It also includes a method to host a two-player game and evaluate the final game state.
